This is the official page of Ananda College Information and Communication Scocity What started in the 80's as the Ananda College 
Computer Club.was a small club for those interested in computers. But as time passed by, the club was transformed, slowly but 
surely, into one of the leaders in the school computer arena, through the hard work and dedication of it's members.

In 2006, in keeping with the requirements of our fast paced wolrd, it became apparent that change was needed, Undergoing a
phoenix rebirthm the society was transformed into ACICTS - Ananda College Information and Communication Technology Society, 
which rose from the ashes as majestic as ever. The change was made necessary by the fact that the society took an interest in
all things related to ICT not just computing.
